# 🧪 Chemical Inventory Management Dashboard (Power BI)

This project showcases a dynamic Power BI dashboard built to manage and monitor a large chemical inventory. Designed for use in a school science department, the dashboard improves data visibility, tracks hazardous substances, and supports safe storage and compliance practices.

## 📊 Features

- Total inventory overview with interactive filters (e.g., storage location, supplier)
- Breakdown of chemicals by hazard classification (GHS pictograms, signal words)
- Expiry date tracking with alert visual
- Filterable tables and charts for efficient auditing and reordering
- Supports data-driven stock management and safety compliance

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop
- Excel for data preparation
- GHS data and COSHH classification references


## 🖼️ Dashboard Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of a large chemical inventory, designed for use in a science department or laboratory setting. It includes visual summaries of hazard classifications, chemical stock levels, expiry tracking, and supplier distribution.
